Hello! I’m Arif, a seasoned user assistance developer, writer, and editor. I specialize in writing for developer audiences —both experts and beginners. In the past I worked at Postman Labs, Turvo, Oracle, and Paysafe - writing API references and testing APIs using Postman.

At Postman, I drove the entire API Platform documentation providing documentation strategy and vision as a lone writer. 

My work includes API reference documentation, API tutorials like QuickStart, Getting Started, and API Error Messages. I also worked on SDKs and UX messages. If interested, you can check out my portfolio, services, and philosophy of technical writing.

I’ve had the pleasure of testing API endpoints while writing API docs for great companies since 2014. Most of my work has been with technology, CRM, Supply Chain and FinTech companies desperate to simplify their help documents.

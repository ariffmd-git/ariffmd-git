Hello! I’m Arif, a seasoned user assistance developer, writer, and editor. I specialize in writing for developer audiences —both experts and beginners. In the past I worked at Postman Labs, writing technical docs and content for the Postman platform.

My work includes API documentation, software guides, SDKs, and UX messages. If interested, you can check out my portfolio, services, and philosophy of technical writing.

I like Linux, languages, and literature. I’d like to combine these three Ls someday. But my current work is pretty cool, too.

I prefer free, open, and copyleft.

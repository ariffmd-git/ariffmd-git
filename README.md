Hello! I’m Arif, and this is my GitHub account where I put a lot of stuff. I use GitHub to:

* Play around with programs in Python, Java, GoLang, and JavaScript:

* I’ve had the pleasure of testing API endpoints while writing API docs for great companies since 2014. Most of my work has been with technology, CRM, Supply Chain and FinTech companies desperate to simplify their help documents.

Hello! I’m Arif, and this is my GitHub account where I put a lot of stuff. I use GitHub to:

* Play around with programs in Python, Java, GoLang, and JavaScript:

* I also use my GitHub to document APIs, API Best Practices, Processes, and anything related to APIs. 

### *My Professional Odyssey*

* I make unfamiliar things look less frightening.

* I write menu names, button names, option labels, dialog box headings, error messages, notifications, and every little thing you see on user interfaces.

* I also write HowTos, tutorials, API references, admin and deployment guides, and other long-form text that you need to get a software up and running and to use it.

* Sometimes, I make videos.

* At other times, I draw wireframes and prototypes for user interfaces.

* At all times, I remain curious. Because, that’s what helps me write for you — my reader — you who will use my words to get your task done as fast as possible.

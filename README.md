Hello! I’m Arif, a seasoned user assistance developer, writer, and editor. I specialize in writing for developer audiences —both experts and beginners. In the past I worked at Postman Labs, Turvo, Oracle, and Paysafe - writing API references and testing APIs using Postman.

At Postman, I drove the entire API Platform documentation providing documentation strategy and vision as a lone writer. 

My work includes API reference documentation, API tutorials like QuickStart, Getting Started, and API Error Messages. I also worked on SDKs and UX messages. If interested, you can check out my portfolio, services, and philosophy of technical writing.
